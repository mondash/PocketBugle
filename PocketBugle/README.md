**Q: Can I use this with [*Virtuoso*][virtuoso] or other bugle audio replacer mods?**  
A: Absolutely! *PocketBugle* spawns the same bugle these mods use — they work great together.

**Q: What if I already have an item equipped?**  
A: Your bugle will only be summoned if you have an available slot. You won't accidentally drop something important!
