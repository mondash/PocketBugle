## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I use this with [*Virtuoso*][virtuoso]?**  
A: Absolutely! *PocketBugle* spawns the same bugle [*Virtuoso*][virtuoso] uses — they work great together.

**Q: What if I already have an item equipped?**  
A: The mod won’t force-swap your current item. You’ll need to free your hand before the bugle can spawn.

**Q: Can I change the keybind?**  
A: Yes — the key is fully configurable in the mod's config file.
